# <u>Tripadvisor Hotel Reviews Sentiment Predictions</u>



## Authors

## Summary of the Project

This application is based on a sentiment analysis model created using the [Trip Advisor Hotel Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/trip-advisor-hotel-reviews)  dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com), and the application is able to predict a rating of 1 - 5 for a given review. Logistic Regression was used to build the prediction model, and the model performed fairly well upon the input of a review. This is my first end to end machine learning project.



#### Key Findings : The model performs really well when predicting the two extreme ends of ratings, which are the ratings of 1 and 5, and its performance drops relatively when predicting the ratings of 2, 3, 4 for a rating based sentiment analysis model.
